# Precise_Entailment_Greek
These are the datasets for the paper "Fine-grained Entailment: Resources for Greek NLI and Precise Entailment". It contains an extension of the Greek FraCaS test suite that includes more inference cases that are dependent on syntax-dependent features of Greek. It further contains a de-dropped version of Greek XNLI, where all pronouns that do not appear in Greek due to its pro-drop nature are inserted, in order to check the effect of pro-drop in inference tasks. Lastly, the RTE version of SuperGLUE is annotated with missing premises, when needed to make the inference.
